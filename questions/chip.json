Throughout the video, before the final reveal of chips contained in each cup, only two types of actions occur: adding one chip to a cup or removing one chip from a cup. Then, the video ends by displaying the final chips contained in each cup.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the cups currently contain exactly the same chips as they did at the start of the video, to ensure that `cup0` contains exactly the following chips: `5, 5, 5, 100, 10, 5` (order does not matter), what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup.

Throughout the video, before the final reveal of chips contained in each cup, only two types of actions occur: adding one chip to a cup or removing one chip from a cup. Then, the video ends by displaying the final chips contained in each cup.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the cups currently contain exactly the same chips as they did at the start of the video, to ensure that `cup0` contains exactly the following chips: `100` (order does not matter), what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 20 to cup0, remove 50 cup0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 20 to cup0, remove 50 cup0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, a series of actions are carried out. Note that there are only two types of actions: adding one chip to a cup or removing one chip from a cup.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the cups currently contain exactly the same chips as they did at the end of the video, to ensure that `cup0` contains exactly the following chips: `5, 5, 100, 100, 50, 20, 50` (order does not matter), what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 20 to cup0, remove 50 cup0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup.

Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup.

Throughout the video, before the final reveal of chips contained in each cup, only two types of actions occur: adding one chip to a cup or removing one chip from a cup. Then, the video ends by displaying the final chips contained in each cup.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the cups currently contain exactly the same chips as they did at the start of the video, to ensure that `cup1` contains exactly the following chips: `20, 5, 50, 20, 100, 10` (order does not matter), what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 20 to cup0, remove 50 cup0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Also, what is the difference in value between the two times?\nFormat your response like this:\n {time_with_higher_value}, {difference_in_value} (e.g., start, 115).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Throughout the video, before the final reveal of chips contained in each cup, only two types of actions occur: adding one chip to a cup or removing one chip from a cup. Then, the video ends by displaying the final chips contained in each cup.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the cups currently contain exactly the same chips as they did at the start of the video, to ensure that `cup0` contains exactly the following chips: `5, 100, 5, 5, 5, 5` (order does not matter), what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 20 to cup0, remove 50 cup0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Throughout the video, before the final reveal of chips contained in each cup, only two types of actions occur: adding one chip to a cup or removing one chip from a cup. Then, the video ends by displaying the final chips contained in each cup.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the cups currently contain exactly the same chips as they did at the start of the video, and now we perform these actions in order: `add 100 to cup0, add 50 to cup0, remove 50 from cup1, remove 10 from cup1, remove 100 from cup0`. How many chips would be in `cup1`? For each chip, provide its value (order does not matter).\nFormat your response like this:\n4 chips: 20, 5, 100, 100.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Throughout the video, before the final reveal of chips contained in each cup, only two types of actions occur: adding one chip to a cup or removing one chip from a cup. Then, the video ends by displaying the final chips contained in each cup.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the cups currently contain exactly the same chips as they did at the start of the video, to ensure that `cup0` contains exactly the following chips: `5, 50, 5, 20, 10, 5, 5` (order does not matter), what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 20 to cup0, remove 50 cup0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Also, what is the difference in value between the two times?\nFormat your response like this:\n {time_with_higher_value}, {difference_in_value} (e.g., start, 115).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Throughout the video, before the final reveal of chips contained in each cup, only two types of actions occur: adding one chip to a cup or removing one chip from a cup. Then, the video ends by displaying the final chips contained in each cup.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the cups currently contain exactly the same chips as they did at the start of the video, to ensure that `cup0` contains exactly the following chips: `5, 5, 5` (order does not matter), what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 20 to cup0, remove 50 cup0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 20 to cup0, remove 50 cup0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Throughout the video, before the final reveal of chips contained in each cup, only two types of actions occur: adding one chip to a cup or removing one chip from a cup. Then, the video ends by displaying the final chips contained in each cup.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the cups currently contain exactly the same chips as they did at the start of the video, to ensure that `cup1` contains exactly the following chips: `5, 20, 5, 10, 50, 5` (order does not matter), what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a chip to a cup or remove a chip from a cup.\n2. Available chips for addition are: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.\n3. You may only remove a chip if it is already present in the cup.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, chip, and cup. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 20 to cup0, remove 50 cup0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

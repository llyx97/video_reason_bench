Throughout the video, before the final reveal of each pile, only two types of actions occur: adding one card to the top of the pile or removing one card from the bottom of the pile. Then, the video ends by displaying the final arrangement of cards in each pile from top to bottom.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the piles currently contain exactly the same cards as they did at the start of the video, to ensure that `pile0` contains exactly the following cards from top to bottom: `4 of Spades, 2 of Diamonds, 5 of Hearts, Ace of Hearts`, what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a card to a pile or remove a card from a pile.\n2. You may only add cards to the top of a pile or remove cards from the bottom of a pile.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, card, and pile. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 6 of Hearts to pile0, remove King of Clubs from pile0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Each action must either add a card to a pile or remove a card from a pile.\n2. You may only add cards to the top of a pile or remove cards from the bottom of a pile.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, card, and pile.

Each action must either add a card to a pile or remove a card from a pile.\n2. You may only add cards to the top of a pile or remove cards from the bottom of a pile.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, card, and pile.

Each action must either add a card to a pile or remove a card from a pile.\n2. You may only add cards to the top of a pile or remove cards from the bottom of a pile.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, card, and pile.

Note that there are only two types of actions: adding one card to the top of the pile or removing one card from the bottom of the pile.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the piles currently contain exactly the same cards as they did at the end of the video, to ensure that `pile0` contains exactly the following cards from top to bottom: `4 of Spades, Ace of Spades, 8 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, 10 of Diamonds, King of Clubs, 9 of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, Jack of Spades, Queen of Spades, 8 of Diamonds`, what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a card to a pile or remove a card from a pile.\n2. You may only add cards to the top of a pile or remove cards from the bottom of a pile.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, card, and pile. Separate each action with a comma.\nFor example, `add 6 of Hearts to pile0, remove King of Clubs from pile0`\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The cards are then turned face down, after which a series of actions is carried out. Note that there are only two types of actions: adding one card to the top of the pile or removing one card from the bottom of the pile.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the piles currently contain exactly the same cards as they did at the end of the video, to ensure that `pile1` contains exactly the following cards from top to bottom: `6 of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, 3 of Hearts, 8 of Spades, 10 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, 10 of Spades`, what sequence of actions should be performed?\nRules:\n1. Each action must either add a card to a pile or remove a card from a pile.\n2. You may only add cards to the top of a pile or remove cards from the bottom of a pile.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, card, and pile.

Each action must either add a card to a pile or remove a card from a pile.\n2. You may only add cards to the top of a pile or remove cards from the bottom of a pile.\n\nResponse Format:\nList the actions in sequence, specifying the action, card, and pile.

Throughout the video, before the final reveal of each pile, only two types of actions occur: adding one card to the top of the pile or removing one card from the bottom of the pile. Then, the video ends by displaying the final arrangement of cards in each pile from top to bottom.\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the piles currently contain exactly the same cards as they did at the start of the video, and now we perform these actions in order: `add 5 of Hearts to pile1, add 9 of Clubs to pile1, remove 9 of Diamonds from pile1, remove Jack of Clubs from pile1`. What cards would be in `pile1`? List them in order from top to bottom, including both the value and suit of each card.\nFormat your response like this:\n6 of Hearts, King of Clubs, 3 of Spades.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): white, (a,2): black, (b,0): white, (b,1): white, (b,2): white, (c,0): white, (c,1): black, (c,2): white`?

Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `left`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the start of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `right`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `up`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, right, down, up, down`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): black, (a,2): black, (b,0): black, (b,1): white, (b,2): black, (c,0): black, (c,1): black, (c,2): black`?

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 1st to 6th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `down`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): white, (a,2): white, (b,0): white, (b,1): white, (b,2): black, (c,0): black, (c,1): black, (c,2): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black.

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 6th to 9th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 4th to 10th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `right`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, up, down`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): white, (a,2): black, (b,0): black, (b,1): white, (b,2): white, (c,0): white, (c,1): white, (c,2): white`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): black, (a,2): white, (b,0): white, (b,1): white, (b,2): white, (c,0): black, (c,1): white, (c,2): white`?

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 7th to 8th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `right`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `down`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the start of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected.

Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids?

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, down, right`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): white, (a,2): black, (b,0): white, (b,1): black, (b,2): white, (c,0): black, (c,1): black, (c,2): white`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): black, (a,2): black, (b,0): white, (b,1): black, (b,2): black, (c,0): black, (c,1): white, (c,2): black`?

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 1st to 4th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `down`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `right`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `down, right, up, down, right`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `down, right, left`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid?

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): black, (a,2): white, (b,0): white, (b,1): black, (b,2): white, (c,0): black, (c,1): black, (c,2): black`?

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 10th to 14th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 5th to 14th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `right`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `down`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `right, down, down, right`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `right, up, down, up, right`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): white, (a,2): black, (b,0): white, (b,1): black, (b,2): black, (c,0): black, (c,1): white, (c,2): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 3x3 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): black, (a,2): black, (b,0): white, (b,1): white, (b,2): black, (c,0): black, (c,1): white, (c,2): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 1st to 4th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 2nd to 6th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 2nd to 3rd moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `left`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the start of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): white, (a,2): black, (a,3): black, (b,0): white, (b,1): white, (b,2): white, (b,3): black, (c,0): white, (c,1): black, (c,2): black, (c,3): white, (d,0): white, (d,1): black, (d,2): black, (d,3): black`?

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): white, (a,2): black, (a,3): black, (b,0): black, (b,1): black, (b,2): white, (b,3): black, (c,0): black, (c,1): black, (c,2): black, (c,3): black, (d,0): white, (d,1): black, (d,2): white, (d,3): white`?

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 4th to 7th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the end of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids?

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, right, right, down, left`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): black, (a,2): white, (a,3): black, (b,0): white, (b,1): black, (b,2): black, (b,3): black, (c,0): white, (c,1): white, (c,2): black, (c,3): white, (d,0): white, (d,1): white, (d,2): black, (d,3): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `up`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `left`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the end of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `down, left, up`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, down, left`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): white, (a,2): white, (a,3): black, (b,0): black, (b,1): white, (b,2): black, (b,3): white, (c,0): black, (c,1): white, (c,2): black, (c,3): black, (d,0): white, (d,1): black, (d,2): white, (d,3): white`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 3rd to 6th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 3rd to 7th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the end of the video?

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the start of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, left, left, right, right`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `left, left, down`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): black, (a,2): white, (a,3): white, (b,0): black, (b,1): white, (b,2): black, (b,3): black, (c,0): white, (c,1): black, (c,2): white, (c,3): white, (d,0): black, (d,1): black, (d,2): white, (d,3): white`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 6th to 9th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 3rd to 7th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `left`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `up`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the end of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the start of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `left, down, up, left, right`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `down, right, up, left`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): white, (a,2): white, (a,3): white, (b,0): white, (b,1): white, (b,2): white, (b,3): white, (c,0): white, (c,1): black, (c,2): black, (c,3): white, (d,0): black, (d,1): white, (d,2): black, (d,3): black`?

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 5th to 6th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 7th to 10th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `right`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `right`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the end of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the start of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, right, up, down`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, right, down`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): white, (a,2): black, (a,3): white, (b,0): white, (b,1): white, (b,2): black, (b,3): white, (c,0): black, (c,1): white, (c,2): black, (c,3): black, (d,0): black, (d,1): black, (d,2): black, (d,3): white`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): white, (a,2): black, (a,3): white, (b,0): white, (b,1): black, (b,2): white, (b,3): white, (c,0): white, (c,1): white, (c,2): white, (c,3): white, (d,0): black, (d,1): black, (d,2): black, (d,3): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 1st to 9th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 4th to 9th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `down`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `up`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the end of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the start of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, left, up, left, left`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, down, up, right`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): black, (a,2): black, (a,3): black, (b,0): black, (b,1): white, (b,2): black, (b,3): black, (c,0): black, (c,1): black, (c,2): white, (c,3): black, (d,0): white, (d,1): black, (d,2): black, (d,3): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): black, (a,2): black, (a,3): white, (b,0): white, (b,1): black, (b,2): white, (b,3): white, (c,0): white, (c,1): black, (c,2): black, (c,3): black, (d,0): white, (d,1): white, (d,2): black, (d,3): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 8th to 11th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 10th to 13th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `down`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `left`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the end of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the start of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `up, down, right, down, up`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `left, right, left, up`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): white, (a,2): white, (a,3): black, (b,0): black, (b,1): black, (b,2): white, (b,3): white, (c,0): black, (c,1): black, (c,2): white, (c,3): white, (d,0): black, (d,1): black, (d,2): white, (d,3): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): black, (a,1): black, (a,2): white, (a,3): black, (b,0): white, (b,1): black, (b,2): white, (b,3): black, (c,0): white, (c,1): black, (c,2): white, (c,3): white, (d,0): white, (d,1): white, (d,2): black, (d,3): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move.

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. What are the directions (left, right, up, down) of the 4th to 10th moves made by the red circle in the video? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `right`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Given the movement direction `down`, how many times does the red circle perform this move? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the position before the move (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the end of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the arrangement of the black and white pieces on the grid at the start of the video? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the end of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. Compare the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid at the start and end of the video. What are the coordinates where the piece color differ between the two grids? Provide these coordinates along with the corresponding piece color at the start of the video, using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black, (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `right, down, down, down`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `left, right, down, right`, what will be the arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid? Provide each piece's coordinates and color using the format: (column, row): color (e.g., (a,1): black; (c,2): white).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. At the beginning of the video, all positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. Then, these pieces are visually hidden but still remain in their original positions. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nPlease carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): white, (a,2): white, (a,3): white, (b,0): black, (b,1): black, (b,2): black, (b,3): white, (c,0): black, (c,1): black, (c,2): white, (c,3): black, (d,0): black, (d,1): black, (d,2): white, (d,3): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 4x4 grid. All positions on the grid are filled with either a black or white piece. These pieces are visually hidden at the beginning of the video. A red circle then moves across the grid.\n\nEach time the red circle passes by a position on the grid (excluding the starting position), the color of the piece at that position *and* the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are flipped: black becomes white, and white becomes black. Note that diagonal neighbors are *not* affected. Neighbors are only considered if they exist within the grid's boundaries.\n\nThe video ends by showing the final arrangement of black and white pieces on the grid. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time the red circle moves from one grid intersection to an adjacent one (horizontally or vertically), it counts as one move. The red circle cannot move beyond the grid boundary. If the arrangement of black and white pieces and the position of the red circle on the grid is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed by the red circle to achieve the desired arrangement of black and white pieces: `(a,0): white, (a,1): white, (a,2): black, (a,3): black, (b,0): white, (b,1): black, (b,2): white, (b,3): black, (c,0): black, (c,1): white, (c,2): white, (c,3): black, (d,0): white, (d,1): white, (d,2): white, (d,3): black`? List them in order.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

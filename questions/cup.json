For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(a1, c3), (b1, b3), (b1, b2), (a2, b1)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins?

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a3, b2`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 3rd to 5th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(a2, b2), (a3, c3), (b2, a3), (b3, c2), (a3, c3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 1st to 3rd moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 4th to 8th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(b3, c1), (b2, a3), (a2, b2)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 3rd to 7th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 5th to 9th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 3x3 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(b2, c3), (b1, b3), (b2, c2), (b3, c2), (b1, a1)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 3x3 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 1st to 3rd moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'c' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'c' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(b3, c3), (a3, b3), (a3, b3), (b3, c2)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(c1, a1), (b1, a1), (c2, a1)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a2, b2, c2`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 3rd to 10th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 2nd to 4th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'a' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'c' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 3x3 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(a3, c2), (a1, c3), (b3, c1), (c3, a1), (b1, b3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a2, a3, b2, c2`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, b1, b2, b3, c1`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 9th to 13th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 1st to 13th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'c' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(c1, c3), (a2, b3), (c1, c3), (b1, a3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 3x3 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(a3, c3), (b1, b3), (a2, a1), (a3, c2)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a2, a3, c2`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 3x3 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a2, b1, b3, c2`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 4th to 11th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 3x3 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 2nd to 5th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'a' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(a2, c1), (b2, a3), (b3, c2)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(c2, a1), (b1, c3), (a2, b1), (b2, c3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a2, a3, c1, c2`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a2, b3, c1, c2`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 2nd to 3rd moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 4th to 5th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 4x4 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(d4, a1), (b1, c3), (d2, a1)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 3rd to 6th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 1st to 3rd moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(b2, a3), (c4, d3), (d2, b2), (d3, c2)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 4th to 6th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 1st to 3rd moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'd' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(b1, d2), (d4, c3), (d2, c2), (a3, b3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(b1, d2), (a2, a4), (d4, b4), (d2, b3), (b1, a4)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 1st to 2nd moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 4th to 8th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'c' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(d4, b4), (b3, c2), (a1, c3), (d2, d1)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(d3, d4), (b1, a2), (d2, c3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a2, b4, d2`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 6th to 9th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 4th to 7th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'c' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'a' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(a3, d3), (c4, c2), (b2, b4), (c2, c3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(c2, a1), (a3, b4), (c4, c2), (c4, c2), (b3, a4)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b3, b4, c1, c2, c3, c4, d3`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 4x4 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b2, b4, c1, c2, c4, d1, d4`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 3rd to 5th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 1st to 9th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'd' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(d1, a1), (c4, a4), (d4, a1), (d2, b4), (c4, d3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(b1, c3), (b1, c2), (b1, b3), (c4, d3), (a2, c2)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a2, b3, b4, c1, d1, d2, d4`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a2, b3, c2, c3, c4, d2, d4`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 2nd to 5th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 3rd to 7th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'c' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(c4, d3), (d2, d4), (d2, a2), (d4, c2), (c3, a1)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(d1, a1), (b3, a1), (d3, a4), (a3, b4), (c2, c3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a3, b2, b3, b4, c1, d4`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a4, b3, c1, c2, d1, d4`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 4th to 5th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 6th to 7th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'c' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'a' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(b2, c1), (a2, d2), (b3, d1), (c1, c2)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 4x4 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(b1, b3), (b4, d1), (c1, c3), (b2, b3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a2, c1, d1, d3, d4`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `b1, b4, c2, c3, d1, d2`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 8th to 13th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 4th to 11th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(d4, d1), (c4, b3), (b2, a4), (b2, c3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(c4, c2), (b1, c2), (a3, d1)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, b1, b3, c1, c2, c3, c4, d1, d2, d3, d4`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 4x4 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a2, a3, a4, b1, b2, b4, c1, c2, c4, d2, d3`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 4th to 5th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssume that each time two cups swap their positions, it counts as one move. What are the 5th to 7th moves shown in the video? For each move, provide the move number and the coordinates of the two cups that swapped positions. Format your response like this: 1st: (a1, b2), 2nd: (c2, b1), 3rd: (a3, c1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times were the cups in the row 'b' involved in the swaps? For each instance, provide the coordinate(s) of the cup(s) before the swap occurred. Format your response like this: 1st: a1, 2nd: a3, 3rd: (a1,a2) (Use a single coordinate for individual cups, or a tuple for multiple cups involved in the same swap.)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the positions of all the coins at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each coin (e.g., a2, b1, c3).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the end of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nCompare the distribution of contents beneath the cups at the start and end of the video. What are the positions where the contents beneath the cups differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding content at the start of the video. Format your response like this: a1: empty, b3: coin.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(c4, b1), (b2, b3), (a2, a1), (d3, a1), (d2, c3)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a 'Tricky Cup' puzzle on a 4x4 board. The board is filled with blue cups, each hiding either a yellow coin or nothing underneath. Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following cup swaps are executed in order: `(c4, a2), (d3, c1), (b3, a1), (d2, b3), (d3, d1)`, what will be the new distribution of the coins? Provide the coordinates of the coins (e.g., a1, b2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

At the start, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a4, b2, c1, c2, c4`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, the contents under the cups are completely hidden. Then, the cups begin a series of moves\u2014each move swaps the positions of two cups, along with their hidden contents. Toward the end, all cups are briefly lifted to reveal what's beneath them. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the distribution of coins on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of cup swaps should be executed to achieve the desired distribution of coins: `a1, a3, b1, d3, d4`? Format your response as a list of coordinate pairs, such as: (a1, b2), (c3, b1). Each pair represents a single swap between two cups.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

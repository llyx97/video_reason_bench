Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the start of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'leftward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 2nd to 3rd blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 2nd to 4th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `leftward, downward, leftward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 6, (a,2): 4, (a,3): 0, (b,1): 8, (b,2): 5, (b,3): 7, (c,1): 1, (c,2): 2, (c,3): 3`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 3rd to 11th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'leftward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `downward, leftward, rightward, rightward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 8, (a,2): 3, (a,3): 7, (b,1): 6, (b,2): 1, (b,3): 2, (c,1): 5, (c,2): 4, (c,3): 0`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'downward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'rightward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the end of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 2, (a,2): 0, (a,3): 3, (b,1): 5, (b,2): 6, (b,3): 8, (c,1): 7, (c,2): 1, (c,3): 4`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the start of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'leftward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 6, (a,2): 10, (a,3): 11, (a,4): 5, (b,1): 7, (b,2): 0, (b,3): 15, (b,4): 8, (c,1): 12, (c,2): 13, (c,3): 2, (c,4): 14, (d,1): 3, (d,2): 4, (d,3): 9, (d,4): 1`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 6, (a,2): 10, (a,3): 11, (a,4): 5, (b,1): 15, (b,2): 8, (b,3): 0, (b,4): 14, (c,1): 7, (c,2): 12, (c,3): 13, (c,4): 2, (d,1): 3, (d,2): 4, (d,3): 9, (d,4): 1`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 2nd to 5th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the end of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the start of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 6, (a,2): 15, (a,3): 2, (a,4): 5, (b,1): 4, (b,2): 10, (b,3): 14, (b,4): 3, (c,1): 7, (c,2): 13, (c,3): 12, (c,4): 8, (d,1): 1, (d,2): 11, (d,3): 0, (d,4): 9`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 6, (a,2): 15, (a,3): 5, (a,4): 3, (b,1): 7, (b,2): 4, (b,3): 14, (b,4): 2, (c,1): 10, (c,2): 0, (c,3): 13, (c,4): 12, (d,1): 1, (d,2): 11, (d,3): 9, (d,4): 8`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'rightward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'downward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the end of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the start of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 5, (a,2): 8, (a,3): 7, (a,4): 1, (b,1): 14, (b,2): 0, (b,3): 12, (b,4): 15, (c,1): 13, (c,2): 9, (c,3): 11, (c,4): 3, (d,1): 2, (d,2): 10, (d,3): 4, (d,4): 6`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 5, (a,2): 8, (a,3): 7, (a,4): 1, (b,1): 14, (b,2): 12, (b,3): 0, (b,4): 15, (c,1): 10, (c,2): 9, (c,3): 11, (c,4): 3, (d,1): 13, (d,2): 2, (d,3): 4, (d,4): 6`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 6th to 9th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'leftward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the end of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the end of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the start of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `downward, rightward, upward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 3, (a,2): 2, (a,3): 1, (a,4): 13, (b,1): 11, (b,2): 9, (b,3): 8, (b,4): 12, (c,1): 6, (c,2): 0, (c,3): 14, (c,4): 4, (d,1): 15, (d,2): 10, (d,3): 5, (d,4): 7`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 3, (a,2): 2, (a,3): 0, (a,4): 8, (b,1): 11, (b,2): 14, (b,3): 9, (b,4): 1, (c,1): 6, (c,2): 4, (c,3): 5, (c,4): 13, (d,1): 15, (d,2): 10, (d,3): 7, (d,4): 12`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 7th to 8th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 4th to 10th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it.

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the end of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the end of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the start of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `upward, rightward, rightward, downward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `rightward, downward, leftward, rightward, upward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 4, (a,2): 10, (a,3): 11, (a,4): 1, (b,1): 0, (b,2): 2, (b,3): 7, (b,4): 6, (c,1): 15, (c,2): 3, (c,3): 13, (c,4): 8, (d,1): 14, (d,2): 12, (d,3): 9, (d,4): 5`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a sliding puzzle on a 4x4 board. The board is filled with numbered squares, with one empty space. Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 4, (a,2): 10, (a,3): 11, (a,4): 1, (b,1): 2, (b,2): 3, (b,3): 7, (b,4): 6, (c,1): 15, (c,2): 12, (c,3): 13, (c,4): 8, (d,1): 14, (d,2): 0, (d,3): 9, (d,4): 5`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 5th to 9th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 2nd to 5th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'leftward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the end of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the end of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the start of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `downward, rightward, upward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `upward, downward, upward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 2, (a,2): 6, (a,3): 15, (a,4): 1, (b,1): 8, (b,2): 3, (b,3): 12, (b,4): 11, (c,1): 9, (c,2): 5, (c,3): 4, (c,4): 0, (d,1): 7, (d,2): 10, (d,3): 13, (d,4): 14`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 2, (a,2): 6, (a,3): 15, (a,4): 1, (b,1): 8, (b,2): 5, (b,3): 3, (b,4): 11, (c,1): 9, (c,2): 12, (c,3): 0, (c,4): 4, (d,1): 7, (d,2): 10, (d,3): 13, (d,4): 14`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 1st to 12th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 8th to 9th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'rightward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'downward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the end of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the end of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the start of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `downward, downward, downward, rightward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `downward, downward, downward, upward, upward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a sliding puzzle on a 4x4 board. The board is filled with numbered squares, with one empty space. The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 5, (a,2): 2, (a,3): 4, (a,4): 11, (b,1): 10, (b,2): 8, (b,3): 0, (b,4): 15, (c,1): 7, (c,2): 14, (c,3): 1, (c,4): 6, (d,1): 13, (d,2): 9, (d,3): 12, (d,4): 3`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 5, (a,2): 2, (a,3): 4, (a,4): 11, (b,1): 10, (b,2): 14, (b,3): 8, (b,4): 1, (c,1): 0, (c,2): 9, (c,3): 12, (c,4): 15, (d,1): 7, (d,2): 13, (d,3): 3, (d,4): 6`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 2nd to 14th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nWhat are the 3rd to 7th blue squares being moved? For each moved blue square, provide the following details:\nThe order in which it was moved (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)\nThe coordinates before it was moved (e.g., (a,1), (c,2), etc)\nThe direction it was moved (e.g., left, right, up, down)\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'rightward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times was the 'upward' move performed in the video? For each occurrence, provide the coordinate of the square (e.g., (a,1), (c,2)...) before the move.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the end of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', what is the arrangement of numbers on the board at the start of the video? Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

        "question": "The video presents a sliding puzzle on a 4x4 board. The board is filled with numbered squares, with one empty space. The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the end of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nAssuming the empty square is represented by '0', compare the number arrangements on the board at the start and end of the video. What are the squares where the numbers differ between the two boards? Provide their coordinates along with the corresponding number at the start of the video (e.g., (a,1): 3, (b,1): 1).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, and the following moves are executed: `leftward, upward, downward, leftward, rightward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, and the following moves are executed: `leftward, upward, rightward`, what will be the arrangement of numbers on the board? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Provide the coordinates of each square along with the corresponding number (e.g., (a,1): 3, (a,2): 0, (b,1): 1, (b,2): 2).\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

The video begins by showing the starting arrangement of the numbers on the board. Then, the numbers are visually masked with a blue overlay, and the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the end of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 0, (a,2): 2, (a,3): 11, (a,4): 1, (b,1): 13, (b,2): 5, (b,3): 12, (b,4): 15, (c,1): 14, (c,2): 4, (c,3): 7, (c,4): 10, (d,1): 8, (d,2): 3, (d,3): 6, (d,4): 9`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",

Initially, all numbered squares are visually masked with a blue overlay. Then, the puzzle undergoes a series of movements-only the squares adjacent to the empty space can be shifted into it. The video ends by showing the final arrangement of the numbers on the board. Please carefully watch the video and answer the following question:\n\nIf the arrangement of numbers on the board is currently in the same state as it was at the start of the video, what sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) should be executed to achieve the desired number arrangement: `(a,1): 2, (a,2): 0, (a,3): 11, (a,4): 1, (b,1): 14, (b,2): 5, (b,3): 12, (b,4): 15, (c,1): 8, (c,2): 13, (c,3): 7, (c,4): 10, (d,1): 3, (d,2): 4, (d,3): 6, (d,4): 9`? Assume that the empty square is represented by '0'. Note that moves cannot push any square beyond the board boundary.\n\nProvide a summary of the final answer after 'Final Answer:'",
